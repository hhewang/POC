Provide a small portion of the surface defect segmentation dataset for planar optical components (made of flexible materials), which includes a small portion of the six surface defects in planar optical components, including scratches, cracks, edge fractures, stripes, stains, and pits. Due to project requirements, this dataset is a self-made dataset for reference only and has certain limitations. The complete dataset has not been fully provided yet due to confidentiality reasons.

A small dataset for surface defect segmentation of planar optical components (made of flexible materials) is provided. This dataset covers a small portion of six types of surface defects in planar optical components, including scratches, cracks, edge fractures, stripes, stains, and pits. This dataset is only based on project requirements, and the specific objects and subjects used are limited, with a single type. The types and categories of defects may differ from practical applications. Readers are advised to consider carefully. For confidentiality reasons, the complete dataset has not been fully provided.
